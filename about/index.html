<h1>About Bullion Central</h1>

<p>
Bullion Central is an independent, online-first bullion dealer serving customers across Australia. We specialise in gold and silver bullion products offered with clear descriptions, transparent pricing, and straightforward buying.
</p>

<p>
The business was created to address common issues found in the bullion market, including unclear premiums, inconsistent product descriptions, and pricing confusion caused by foreign currency conversions.
</p>

<h2>Our Approach</h2>

<p>
We focus on clarity rather than volume. Products are listed with accurate metal type, weight, and purity so buyers understand exactly what they are purchasing. Pricing is displayed in Australian dollars, and premiums are applied consistently rather than hidden behind ambiguous language.
</p>

<p>
Bullion Central operates online to reduce unnecessary overheads and maintain control over product quality and information. This allows us to focus on accuracy, transparency, and long-term trust.
</p>

<h2>What We Sell</h2>

<p>
Our range includes gold and silver bullion in the form of bars, coins, and limited hand-poured pieces. Products are offered primarily for their metal content and investment value. Any collectible or aesthetic characteristics are described clearly and are never implied.
</p>

<h2>What We Do Not Do</h2>

<p>
We do not sell mystery stock, bulk lots with unclear provenance, or products described with exaggerated or misleading claims. We avoid hype-driven marketing and focus instead on factual information and consistency.
</p>

<h2>Australian Operation</h2>

<p>
Bullion Central operates within Australia and serves customers nationwide. All pricing is displayed in Australian dollars and all shipments are handled domestically.
