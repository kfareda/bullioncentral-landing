    <h1 style="margin:0 0 16px;">How Bullion Pricing Works</h1>

    <p style="color:#444;margin:0 0 16px;">
      Gold and silver bullion prices are not fixed. They move with global markets,
      currency exchange rates, and supply and demand. This page explains how bullion
      pricing works and how prices are displayed at Bullion Central.
    </p>

    <h2>Spot Price</h2>

    <p style="color:#444;">
      The spot price is the current market price for gold or silver traded on
      international markets. It represents the base value of the metal itself
      before any additional costs are applied.
    </p>

    <p style="color:#444;">
      Spot prices fluctuate continuously during market hours and can move up or
      down based on global economic conditions, currency movements, and investor demand.
    </p>

    <h2>Pricing in Australian Dollars</h2>

    <p style="color:#444;">
      International spot prices are commonly quoted in US dollars. For Australian
      buyers, bullion pricing must be converted into Australian dollars using the
      prevailing exchange rate.
    </p>

    <p style="color:#444;">
      This means bullion prices in AUD can change even if the underlying metal price
      remains stable, due to movements in currency markets.
    </p>

    <h2>Premiums</h2>

    <p style="color:#444;">
      A premium is added to the spot price to cover costs such as minting, fabrication,
      handling, storage, testing, and dealer operations. Premiums vary depending on
      product type, size, and availability.
    </p>

    <p style="color:#444;">
      Smaller bars and coins typically carry higher premiums per gram than larger
      bars due to increased production and handling costs.
    </p>

    <h2>Price Volatility</h2>

    <p style="color:#444;">
      Gold and silver prices can change rapidly. Market movements may occur outside
      normal business hours and pricing can update accordingly when markets reopen.
    </p>

    <p style="color:#444;">
      Because of this volatility, bullion prices may change between viewing a product
      and completing a purchase.
    </p>

    <h2>Pricing Transparency</h2>

    <p style="color:#444;">
      Bullion Central displays prices in Australian dollars and describes products
      clearly by metal type, weight, and purity. Premiums are applied consistently
      rather than hidden behind vague or unclear pricing language.
    </p>

    <p style="color:#444;">
      The goal is to provide buyers with a clear understanding of how prices are formed
      so purchasing decisions can be made with confidence.
    </p>
    
    <p style="color:#444;">
      
    </p>
    <p style="
      margin:10px 0 0;
      font-size:13px;
      color:#666;
      max-width:520px;
    ">
      Bullion prices reflect market conditions at the time of pricing. Prices are
      subject to change and availability may vary. Buyers should always review pricing
      details before confirming a purchase.
